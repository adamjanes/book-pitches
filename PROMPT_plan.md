# Planning Mode

You are planning implementation work for Book Pitches — a voice-first platform for audio book pitches.

Study these to understand the project:
- Read /Users/adamjanes/code/projects/book-pitches/CLAUDE.md for V1 scope and build order
- Read openspec/overview.md for architecture and current state
- Browse openspec/changes/ for all approved proposals (new-schema, auth-setup, audio-recorder, open-library-search, pitch-creation-flow, profile-page, discovery-page, landing-page)
- Check git log --oneline -20 to see what's already been done

Create or update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md at the project root with:
- A prioritized task list following the build order in CLAUDE.md
- Each task should cite the relevant proposal (e.g. "See openspec/changes/new-schema/")
- Each task should reference specific source files that need changes
- Mark completed tasks with [x] based on what git log shows

Do NOT implement anything. Only produce the plan. Then exit.
